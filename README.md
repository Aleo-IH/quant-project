# Quant project

Here is a quant project I intend to develop, building my own framework from analysis to trading. I will start by using Binance as my broker and data collector

## Advancements :

- I have built the fundation of the trading and data collection infrastructure, but I'm currently looking for an idea to build. I don't have concrete examples of what is possible and how to implement it but I'm looking for it.
    
- The first model is a Chain Classifier on Random Forest to try to estimate the quantile in wich future returns will end up. The accuracy is around 30% on each quantile in a rolling window cross-validation, which is above random but clearly not enough to find an edge.
